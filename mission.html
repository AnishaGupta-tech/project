        <p style="font-size:25px;  color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">There has never been a more critical time in history to start considering sustainable and renewable energy solutions<br>Green Powered Future Mission<br>Solar Energy Solutions<br>Renewable Energy Powerhouse<br>To reduce the plastic waste generated by our households.<p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;color:plum;"><b><u>Benefits of Renewable Energy</b></u><br>
                    Environmental and economic benefits of using renewable energy include:<br>
                    
                    Generating energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and reduces some types of air pollution<br>
                    Diversifying energy supply and reducing dependence on imported fuels<br>
                    Creating economic development and jobs in manufacturing, installation, and more<br>
                    Learn how to quantify the multiple benefits of renewable energy with our Guide, or using our benefit evaluation tools.<br><br>
                    
                    <b><u>Implementing On-site Renewable Energy Projects</u></b><br>
                    On-site power generation provides local governments with the most direct access to renewable energy. In addition to the overall benefits, on-site projects also provide a hedge against financial risks and improve power quality and supply reliability.<br><br>
                    
                    However, local governments considering on-site generation may face possible technical, financial, and regulatory challenges. <br>To overcome these challenges, local governments can:<br>
                    
                    Assess the availability of local renewable resources<br>
                    Consider the costs of different renewable technologies<br>
                    Examine the aggregate costs and benefits of on-site green power<br>
                    Consider permitting requirements for locations where the facility could be sited<br>
                    Involve local stakeholders, particularly concerning siting<br>
                    Assess available sources of financing and other incentives</p>
